<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a graduate student in the Department of Data Science at `Stony Brook University`, where I specialize in `Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Data-Driven Decision-Making`. My academic journey is driven by a passion for extracting meaningful insights from data, optimizing models, and building intelligent systems.

My interests span `Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, Computer Vision, Data Visualization`, and large-scale data processing. I actively expand my expertise through coursework, research projects, and hands-on experimentation with cutting-edge technologies.

I bring `four years` of industry experience as a `Software Developer`, having worked at `Regart` and `CGI`. At Regart, I played a key role in architecting and developing a web application used by employees in European financial institutions, ensuring regulatory compliance and efficient document management. I also built data models for regulatory documents and optimized UI navigation. At CGI, I worked on a finance trading platform, integrating real-time currency streaming, multi-window trading, and backend services to improve system performance and responsiveness.

Beyond my technical skills, I am an `Analytical Thinker` with `Strong Problem-Solving Abilities`. I excel in `Collaboration`, `Leadership`, and `Effective Communication`, making me a valuable `Team Player`. My adaptability and curiosity drive me to explore innovative solutions in `AI and Data Science`.

I am `actively seeking internships in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Software Development`. Passionate about technology and research, I continuously look for opportunities to apply my knowledge to real-world challenges.

My online hub houses the highlights of my technical career: significant projects, published research, in-depth articles, and my professional background. Consider this a dynamic space that evolves alongside my professional development.
